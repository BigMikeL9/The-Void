You wake up in the middle of a road surrounded by trees on either side, with no idea how you got there. You get up and 
find a small girl with black long hair staring at you from a distance.

Could approach the creepy girl and ask here where am I. Or say "Hell NAWWW" and run the 
other way, hoping to find a sign of where you are?

What should I do?
1. Approach the small girl - ask her where you are.
2. Run the other way and don't look back.
