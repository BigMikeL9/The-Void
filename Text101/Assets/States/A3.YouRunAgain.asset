  storyText: "You run again as fast as you can the opposite way, away from the girl.
    But once more you find yourself at the exact same spot you woke up from. With
    the girl still staring at you and approaching you everytime you blink. \n\nThis
    is when you realize that you only have one option to end this nightmare. Which
    is to confront the girl!\n\n1. Gather your strength, say you prayers, and hold
