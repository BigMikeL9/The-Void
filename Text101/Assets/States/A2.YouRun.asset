  storyText: 'You run as fast as you can the opposite way, away from the girl. But
    all of a sudden you find yourself at the exact same spot you woke up from. WITH
    THE SAME GIRL STARING AT YOU. Everytime you blink, the girl seems to be getting
    closer to you without moving.


    You could try to run the other way around
    away from the girl, hoping the same thing doesn''t happen. Or you could panic
    and stay where you are, waiting slowly as the creepy girl approach you everytime
    you blink.


    1. Run the other way, again.

    2. Freeze in your place in
    fear, and wait for the girl to reach you.'
