  storyText: "You wake up in the middle of a road surrounded by trees on either side,
    with no idea how you got there. You get up and \r\nfind a small girl with black
    long hair staring at you from a distance.\r\n\r\nYou could approach the creepy
    girl and ask her where am I. Or, say \"Hell NAWWW\" and run the \r\nother way,
    hoping to find a sign of where you are?\r\n\r\nWhat should I do?\r\n1. Approach
    the small girl - ask her where you are.\r\n2. Run the other way and don't look
    back."
